# React Native Mobile Payments SDK Technical Reference

In this reference, you'll find detailed information about the data types and methods available in the React Native plug-in. As an overview, the plug-in is structured as follows:
* `src/managers`: in the native code, different functionality is encapsulated in different managers. In order to port it to React Native, we've organized it in different files in this folder: authentication, payment, reader, and settings. This should roughly map the structure available in the native reference.
* `src/models`: includes the enum definitions, errors, and the objects used in the plug-in. For errors, this serves as a reference for all the possible errors some methods might return.

## Managers
### Authorization (auth.ts)

The Authorization Manager handles authorizing and deauthorizing your application to process payments on behalf of a Square seller using an [OAuth access token](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/what-it-does) and a [location ID](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api)
. OAuth access tokens are used to get authenticated and scoped access to any Square account. These tokens should be used even if you only plan to use the Mobile Payments SDK with your own Square account. For more information, see [OAuth sample applications](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/sample-apps#oauth-samples).

Method                                                    | Returns                       | Description
--------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---
[authorize](#authorize) | locationID | Authorizes the SDK to take payments given an access token and a location ID.
[deauthorize](#deauthorize) | String | Deauthorizes the SDK
[getAuthorizedLocation](#getAuthorizedLocation) | Location | Gets the currently authorized location.
[getAuthorizationState](#getAuthorizationState) | AuthorizationState | Returs the current authorization state AuthorizationState.
[observeAuthorizationChanges](#observeAuthorizationChanges) | EmitterSubscription | Observes authorization state changes. You can pass a callback which takes an AuthorizationState as an argument to react to the changes.
[stopObservingAuthorizationChanges](#stopObservingAuthorizationChanges) | void | Stops observing authorization changes.

## Method details

### authorize

Authorizes the SDK to take payments given an OAuth access token and a location ID.

Parameter | Type   | Description
--------- | ------ | -----------
accessToken | String | Access Token
locationId  | String | Location ID

* **On success**: returns a String which includes the authorized access token and location.
* **On failure**: throws an error which includes the resulting AuthorizationError.

---

### deauthorize

Deauthorizes the SDK.

* **On success**: returns a String which indicates if the deauthorization was sucessful.
* **On failure**: throws an error.

---

### getAuthorizedLocation

Returns the authorized location, if present.

* **On success**: returns a Location object which represents the authorized location, or `nil` if there's no authorized location.
* **On failure**: throws an error.

---

### getAuthorizationState

Returns the current authorization state. This can be used, for instance, to decide whether the app needs to authenticate on start or if it's already been authorized. 

* **On success**: returns a String which represents the current AuthorizationState.
* **On failure**: throws an error.

---
### observeAuthorizationChanges

Observes authorization status changes, by using React Native's own `NativeEventEmitter` class. This allows applications to observe authorization changes, such as deauthorization.

Parameter | Type   | Description
--------- | ------ | -----------
callback | (newState: AuthorizationState) => void | A callback function that takes the newState as an argument.

* **On success**: Will observe authorization changes, invoking the callback when changes happen. Returns the subscription of type `EmitterSubscription`.
* **On failure**: Not applicable.

---
### stopObservingAuthorizationChanges

Stops observing authorization changes. Recommended to call it when presenting a different view, for instance, to not have lingering `EmitterSubscription` objects.

* **On success**: Will remove any observers on authorization.
* **On failure**: Not applicable.


### Payments (payment.ts)

The Payment Manager handles the payment flow for your application, which allows to start a payment, or to cancel an ongoing one.

Method                                                    | Returns                       | Description
--------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---
[startPayment](#startPayment) | Payment | Starts a payment taking payment and prompt parameters, and returns a Payment object, or an error including a PaymentError.
[cancelPayment](#cancelPayment) | void | Cancels an ongoing payment, if possible.


## Method details

### startPayment

Starts a payment taking payment and prompt parameters, and returns a Payment object, or an error including a PaymentError. The payment parameters will include things like the amount, application fees; prompt parameters will include the accepted payment methods, and the mode (which, for now, only covers the default mode). Default prompt mode takes over the entire screen, and handles all the payment interactions.

For details on the parameters, visit the respective PaymentParameters and PromptParameters sections.

Parameter | Type   | Description
--------- | ------ | -----------
paymentParameters | PaymentParameters | Parameters to configure the payment.
promptParameters | PromptParameters | Parameters to configure the prompt.

* **On success**: returns a Payment object, which will include all the information Square captured about the payment.

[hideMockReaderUI](#hideMockReaderUI) | void | Hides the mock reader UI.


## Method details

### showMockReaderUI

When the SDK is started in Sandbox mode (this means, a Sandbox Application ID is given to initialize the SDK, as well as an access token and location that exist in Sandbox), it is possible to simulate payments with mock readers. These readers do not take real money, and allow to simulate card success and failures. The Mock Reader UI is displayed on top of the existing view, and persist through different views until dismissed. To access all the different actions available, tap on the mock reader UI.

* **On success**: shows the mock reader UI.
* **On failure**: throws an error detailing reasons why showing a mock reader isn't possible. Reasons might include: not in sandbox environment, mock reader already presented.
---
### hideMockReaderUI

Dismisses the mock reader.

* **On success**: dismisses the mock reader UI.
* **On failure**: throws an error if the reader can't be dismissed, for instance, if it's not presented.

---
### Settings (reader.ts)

The Settings Manager provides an optional device management UI that you can use in your application and provides details about the current SDK version and environment.

Method                                                    | Returns                       | Description
